;note
	design: "[
		Four basic types of selection:
		
		(1) Tag-based
		(2) Class-based
		(3) ID-based
		(4) Psuedo-class-based
		
		Tag-based ::= Tag_name
		======================
		{CSS_RULE}s are applied to {HTML_TAG}s based on the tag itself. When a
		rule is Tag-based, the signal is to list the tag by name.
		
		Class-based ::= "." Class_name
		==============================
		{CSS_RULE}s are applied to {HTML_TAG}s based on the class(es) ascribed
		to the tag. Each tag may have zero, one, or more classes. When a rule
		is Class-based, the signal is a class name prefixed with a period (".").
		
		ID-based ::= "#" Tag_name
		=========================
		{CSS_RULE}s are appliied to an {HTML_TAG} within an {HTML_PAGE} (or
		tag-universe) by means of an ID value. Within the page, the ID must
		be unique, which is how the Webkit finds the tag in order to apply
		the {CSS_RULE} to it. When a rule is ID-based, the signal is an ID
		name prefixed with a pound-sign ("#").
		
		Pseudo-class-based ::= Tag_name ":" Pseudo_class_name
		=====================================================
		{CSS_RULE}s are applied to {HTML_TAG}s based on pseudo-classes like
		"Hover" (a:Hover for example is what happens when the user hovers
		the mouse over an href link). Pseudo-classes are signaled by the
		tag-name, then a colon-character (":"), and then the name of the
		pseudo-class (e.g. "Hover").
